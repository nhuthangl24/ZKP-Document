### ZK-Kit contributions

**Contributors:**

- Chino Cribioli - @chino_cribioli

**Project Description:**

- Contribution 1:
  In the context of the Lean-IMT package of the library, which is an implementation of a merkle tree in which you can add, erase and modify leaves dynamically, I implemented a method that lets the user modify several leaves at the same time. This improved the worst-case time complexity from O(n.logn) to O(n) in the case where the number of leaves to update is similar to the size of the tree. This is done by updating every node of the tree at most once during the whole execution of the method.  
  A full analysis of the complexity is included in the contribution.

- Contribution 2:
  I detected a vulnerability in the implementation of the Baby JubJub curve in the EdDSA package of the library. This is a type of 'timing attack', which consists of extracting information from the time it takes for the processor to perform a certain process.  
  In this case, based on the time it takes to complete a 'mulPointScalar' call, an attacker could infer the number of 1's in the binary expression of the secret number passed as input since the method is implemented with the classic 'square-and-multiply' algorithm.  
   A deeper description of the problem can be found in the issue I created [https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/zk-kit/issues/324](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/zk-kit/issues/324)

**Technical Stack:**

- Typescript.
- Algorithmic analysis

**Project Goals:**

- Contribution 1:
  Optimize the performance of the package when the number of updates is high.

- Contribution 2:
  Fix the issue to the best of our knowledge. I proposed an implementation of the 'Montgomery Ladder' algorithm, which I learned is a technique used to mitigate this kind of timing attacks.

### MPC Adventures

**Contributors:**

**Project Description:**
Tutorials and explanations of vanilla implementations of MPC primitives: Yao's Garbled Circuits, Oblivious transfer in particular, and Shamir Secret Sharing.

**Technical Stack:**

- Jupyter Notebook with usage of pycryptodome and sagemath.

**Project Goals:**
To offer a source of learning for the implemented primitives based in working code in Python. This offers a bridge between the more mathematical sources (like the corresponding papers) and the community, but at the same time offering concrete code to play with online and gain more understanding. The exercises are offered along with solved versions of the notebooks.

For the future, I want to add automated tests for the code snippets, and to modularize the code a bit (for example the implementation for OT is copied and pasted inside the Garbled Tables one and this takes away the attention from the important part). Also I want to add progressively more versions with some optimizations.

### KZG implementation

**Contributors:**

- Lucas Dario Cardacci

**Project Description:**
Motivation  
Actually, a type of vector commitment scheme uses hash functions to prove the belonging of an element to a vector, counting the number of occurrences and confirming the non-membership with Merkle trees. On my final project for my bachelor's degree in mathematics I present a vector commitment scheme based on KZG, that allows do the same.

Project description  
Implement these schemes non-membership and counting bases on KZG using rust as a principal language of programming.

**Technical Stack:**

- Rust

**Project Goals:**
The end goal of the project is to have a functional Rust library that can be used to prove the membership or non-membership of elements in a vector, as well as count occurrences of elements, using the new schemes based on KZG. The project will be considered successful when the library is thoroughly tested, well-documented, and can be easily integrated into other cryptographic systems.

### Noir Playground

**Contributors:**

- Bruno Weisz - telegram: @TheRasmuz

**Project Description:**
I implemented a web app were you can write Noir programs and perform a series of actions over it, corresponding to the normal workflow of a circuit (compile, execute, prove, verify). Then there's another functionality which corresponds with performing a verification on-chain (create verifier contract, compile it, deploy it and make a transaction to it -using some metamask account-). The idea was to make it all dynamic, so that the contracts can be deployed and verified on-demand.

**Technical Stack:**

- Noir is the DSL to try (Noir.js in the front)
- Vite + React for the frontend (ethers.js for interacting with contracts)
- Node + Express for the backend (backend needed to compile the smart contract)
- Hardhat for launching a local devnet and compile the smart contract

**Project Goals:**

- Easy introduction for more people to the ZK world and the usage of circuits and contracts.
- Provide a generic template for projects using Noir.js where the different parts of the workflow are decoupled.
- Learn myself how to interact with contracts and generate proofs on the browser.

### Jimmy Chu

**Contributors:**

- Jimmy Chu - @jimmychu0807

**Project Description:**
In this game, the goal of each player is to guess closest to the mean of submissions from all participating players. Each game is divided into multiple rounds. In each round, players first pick a commitment value from 1 to 100. The value is processed through a zk-SNARK circuit on the client-side and the proof is submitted and stored on-chain.

After all players submit commitment proofs, they then open and reveal their commitment values. When all players have opened their commitments, the game host concludes the round and the mean will be computed. The one closest to the mean will win the round.

The player who win 3 rounds first win the game.

**Technical Stack:**

- Circuit: Circom, circomkit, plonk
- Smart Contract: Hardhat
- Frontend: Next.js / Smart Contract libraries: viem, wagmi, web3modal
- Overall: Semaphore boilerplate (https://github.com/semaphore-protocol/boilerplate)

**Project Goals:**
Be able to build a zk-SNARK dApp from end to end, and able to get the zk circuit prover, smart contract verifiers, and frontend connect and work together. So I can get a general picture on how to connect the zkp, blockchain, and front end components together.

### p0tion (issue #326)

**Contributors:**

- Nathalia Barreiros - @nathbarreiros

**Project Description:**
I enhanced p0tion's API infrastructure by implementing comprehensive unit tests for the `/packages/api` module.

This NestJS-based API consolidates the coordinator infrastructure for zkSNARK Phase 2 Trusted Setup ceremonies. I wrote tests for Auth, Ceremonies, Circuits, Participants, Storage, and Users modules, covering entities, DTOs, services, and controllers. These tests verify correct functionality, concurrent request handling, and data interactions.

### ZKP to build an on-chain zk-Auction system

**Contributors:**

- Ken
- Wayne
- Kevin

**Project Description:**
Construct a zero-knowledge auction system where the bid amounts from buyers are not disclosed before the deadline (submitted to the smart contract via a commitment scheme). Before submitting their commitments, buyers must prove that their bid is above the reserve price. The smart contract will verify the validity of these proofs. After the deadline, the commitments must be opened to allow the smart contract to determine the winner (the highest bidder). The smart contract will then handle the subsequent transaction process.

**Technical Stack:**

- Web Framework: Next.js
- Front-end: React
- Smart Contract Language: Solidity
- Development and Testing Environment for Blockchain: Hardhat (used for compiling, deploying, and testing smart contracts on Ethereum)

**Project Goals:**
To implement a zk-auction system on blockchain without revealing bidders' own bid amounts

### Taketora

**Contributors:**

- Contributor1 - @wasabi
- Contributor2 - @akafuda

**Project Description:**
This project aims to enhance the security of username handling within our system by introducing a robust range check mechanism in the circuit. This feature will enforce constraints on username values, ensuring they do not exceed the 252-bit limit, thereby mitigating overflow risks. The implementation will allow for configurable range limits based on custodial requirements, enabling greater flexibility while maintaining security.

**Technical Stack:**

- Halo2

**Project Goals:**
The project aims to implement a robust range check mechanism for username values within the circuit to prevent overflow, enable configuration flexibility through a Rust feature flag for toggling this functionality, allow custodians to customize the maximum allowed bit length for usernames to accommodate varying anonymity requirements, and enhance the reliability of the Merkle Sum Tree (MST) by safeguarding against potential overflow issues.
